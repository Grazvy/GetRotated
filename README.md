# GetRotated

- Using a neural network to rotate images, because I can

### modeling choices 

- SGD, since every data instance contains the same operation

- a single fully connected layer, since every pixel should have a unique single allocation

### what to expect

- single feature selection, so every node reacts to a single input
- no biases (b_i = 0)
